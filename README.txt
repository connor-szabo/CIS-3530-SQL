Assignment 3

Parameters
P1 - Customer Name (char(10))
P2 - Vendor Name (char (10))
P3 - Account num (char (5), customer name (char(10)), province (char(5)), Credit Limit (numeric(10))
P4/5/6/7 - No Parameters
P8 - Vendor Number (char(5)), account number (char(5)), amount (numeric(10,2))

Business Assumptions:
Whenever a transaction of some sort takes place, I am assuming that vendors are making money (balance goes up)
and that customers are using a credit card (credit goes up).

Notes:
P8 works except it does not print out results (if you do your own select * you can see the numbers have accurately
changed).

P4 works except it does not display any customers without a transaction.
